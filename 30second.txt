So today I'm telling you about my passion, 'financial knowledge' (stocks, shares, investments etc) 
and why you must also have this passion. 
What do we all desire in life? We want to unlock some sort of an 
abundance and freedom. Financial knowledge is the key to that. 
it's not about working harder and longer hours
but about working smarter. How do billionaires do it? They certainly don't work over
60 hours per week ..... even if they say they do. 
knowledge is power, except
noone teaches proper financial knowledge in schools. It's simply not in their interest to do so.
Let's take tax efficiency for instance.
Understanding how to structure your investments to minimize taxes can not only save you 
money but quite frankly can make you a billionaire. Learn to invest, leverage financial tools
to make your money work for you, not the other way around, start today!
